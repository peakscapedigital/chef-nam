## Deliverables

1. **Working Astro Project**
   - Configured with TypeScript, Tailwind, and Sanity
   - Development environment ready for team use

2. **Sanity CMS Setup**
   - Complete content schemas
   - Studio configured and accessible
   - Sample content created

3. **Base Components**
   - Layout system with Header/Footer
   - Navigation with mobile menu
   - Core UI components (Button, Card, Form elements)

4. **Documentation**
   - Setup instructions in README
   - Component usage examples
   - Development workflow documented

## Notes

### Key Decisions
- **Framework**: Astro 4.x for optimal SEO and performance
- **CMS**: Sanity for flexible content management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom brand configuration
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode for better code quality

### Risk Mitigation
- **Sanity Learning Curve**: Allocate extra time for schema design
- **Astro Islands**: Start with static components, add interactivity incrementally
- **Mobile Navigation**: Test on actual devices, not just browser tools

### Success Metrics
- All team members can run project locally
- Content editors can create/edit content in Sanity
- Components render consistently across browsers
- Performance metrics baseline established

### Dependencies for Next Milestone
- Working development environment
- Sanity content structure finalized
- Base layout and navigation functional
- Component library foundation ready
